# Wizehire Mantine Fork

This repo is a fork of the Mantine component library with the Wizehire theme applied. It's hosted on github pages and serves as themed documentation for the Mantine-based Wizehire design system.

The theme is imported from the `@wizehire/theme` package, which lives in the `src/react/packages/theme` folder of `https://github.com/WizeHire/main`. Although the docs site is a fork of a public library, the theme itself is part of a private repo, intended for internal use by Wizehire.
